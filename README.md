## ⭐ Overview
This spreadsheet is designed for **regular W-2 employees with simple tax situations** who want to file their 2025 taxes **without paying** TurboTax, H&R Block, or other upsell-driven services.

- Some **1099-INT / 1099-DIV** earnings,  
- Basic **bank interest**,  
- Small **capital gains**,  
- Simple **charitable or mortgage deductions**,  

…then this organizer helps you total everything and manually transfer your numbers into **IRS Form 1040**.

No accounts.  
No tracking.  
No data collection.  
No upsells.  
No “extra protection” add-ons.  
Just a spreadsheet.

## 🧠 What the Organizer Does
- Totals **W-2 wages** and **federal withholding**  
- Totals **1099 interest**, dividends, capital gains, and misc income  
- Computes **total income**  
- Helps you evaluate **standard vs. itemized deduction**  
- Includes logic for:
  - SALT deduction cap ($10,000)
  - Medical expenses over 7.5% of income  
  - Charitable contributions  
  - Mortgage interest  
- Calculates **taxable income**  
- Summarizes **all withholding**  
- Provides a **mapping table** so you can transfer values directly into IRS Form 1040

This is **not** a tax calculator.  
It is a **tax organizer** — it prepares you to file.

## ❤️ Why This Exists
Millions of people with simple incomes are paying $40–$200+ every year because tax companies make the filing process intentionally confusing.

Filing simple taxes should be **free**.  
And **private**.  
And **easy**.

This project is an attempt to move things a little closer to that ideal.
